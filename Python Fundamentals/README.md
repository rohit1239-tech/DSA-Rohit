Python Basics
Python is like learning to ride a bicycle.

First time: Scary, wobbly, might fall
After practice: Smooth, fun, you wonder why you were scared
Let's begin your Python journey.

What is Python?
Simple Definition:
Python is a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE - a way to talk to computers.

Remember from Lecture 1?

Computer understands only 0s and 1s (binary)
We need a translator (programming language)
Python is that translator
Why Python?
Python is like the EASIEST language to learn.

Think of programming languages like languages:

C++ = Like learning Chinese (hard, complex)
Java = Like learning French (medium difficulty)
Python = Like learning Hindi if you know English (easy, similar words)
Python is:

Easy to read (looks almost like English)
Simple to write (less rules, less confusion)
Very popular (used by Google, Netflix, Instagram)
Powerful (can build websites, apps, AI, games)
Real Life Analogy - The Friendly Teacher:
Imagine two teachers:

Teacher A: Speaks complex words, strict rules, hard to understand
Teacher B: Speaks simple words, explains clearly, makes learning fun
Python is Teacher B. It's designed to be beginner-friendly.

What Can You Build with Python?
Websites (Instagram, Pinterest use Python)
Games (like simple mobile games)
Data analysis (finding patterns in data)
AI and Machine Learning (ChatGPT uses Python!)
Automation (making computer do repetitive tasks)
Mobile apps (with frameworks)
But for now, focus on learning basics. Big projects come later.

Installing Python - Setting Up Your Tools
Before You Start:
You need Python installed on your computer. Like you need a pen to write, you need Python to write Python programs.

Step-by-Step Installation:
For Windows:
Go to python.org
Click "Downloads"
Download Python 3.x (latest version)
Run the installer
IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" (very important!)
Click "Install Now"
Wait for installation
Done!
For Mac:
Python usually comes pre-installed
Open Terminal
Type: python3 --version
If you see a version number, Python is installed!
If not, go to python.org and download
For Linux:
Open terminal
Type: sudo apt install python3
Enter password
Wait for installation
Done!
How to Check if Python is Installed:
Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
Type: python --version (or python3 --version)
If you see something like "Python 3.11.5", you're good!
If you see "command not found", Python is not installed
Don't Worry:
If installation seems hard, it's okay. Ask for help. Everyone struggles with installation the first time. Once it's done, you never have to do it again.

What is a Python Interpreter?
Simple Definition:
An INTERPRETER is like a TRANSLATOR that converts your Python code into something the computer understands.

Remember the analogy from Lecture 1?

You speak Hindi
Computer speaks only 0s and 1s
Interpreter is the translator in between
How It Works:
You write Python code (in English-like words)
Interpreter reads your code
Interpreter converts it to 0s and 1s
Computer executes it
You see the result
Real Life Analogy - The Restaurant Waiter:
You (customer) → Waiter (interpreter) → Chef (computer)

You order: "I want biryani" (Python code)
Waiter understands and tells chef: "One biryani" (translation)
Chef makes biryani (computer executes)
Waiter brings it to you (result shown)
The interpreter is like that waiter - it understands both you and the computer.

Two Ways to Use Python:
Interactive Mode (Python Shell):
Type code, see result immediately
Like a calculator - type, get answer
Good for: Testing small code, learning
Script Mode (Python File):
Write code in a file
Save it
Run the entire file
Good for: Writing programs, saving work
We'll use both. Don't worry, you'll understand as we go.

Code Editors - Where You Write Code
What is a Code Editor?
A CODE EDITOR is like a special notebook for writing code.

Think of it like:

Microsoft Word = For writing documents
Code Editor = For writing code
Why Not Use Notepad?
You CAN use Notepad, but code editors are better because they:

Show colors (makes code easier to read)
Find mistakes (like spell-check)
Auto-complete (suggests words as you type)
Format code (makes it look neat)
Popular Code Editors:
VS Code (Visual Studio Code) - RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS
Free
Easy to use
Works on all computers
Very popular
PyCharm
Made specifically for Python
Free version available
A bit complex for beginners
Sublime Text
Simple and fast
Free to try
IDLE (comes with Python)
Simple
Good for absolute beginners
Limited features
Recommendation:
Start with VS Code. It's the most beginner-friendly and widely used.

How to Install VS Code:
Go to code.visualstudio.com
Download for your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux)
Install it (just click Next, Next, Install)
Open VS Code
Done!
You don't need to learn everything about VS Code now. Just install it. We'll learn as we use it.

Your First Python Program - Hello World!
The Tradition:
Every programmer's first program is "Hello World" - printing "Hello, World!" on screen. It's like a tradition. Like saying "Namaste" when you meet someone.

Let's do it!

Method 1: Using Python Shell (Interactive Mode)
Python

print("Hello, World!")
You'll see: Hello, World!

That's it! Your first program!

What Just Happened?
print = A command that shows text on screen
("Hello, World!") = The text you want to show
The quotes tell Python: "This is text, not code"
Think of print like:

A megaphone that announces what you say
You say "Hello, World!" into megaphone
Everyone hears "Hello, World!"
Method 2: Using a File (Script Mode)
Python

print("Hello, World!")
Open VS Code (or any text editor)
Create a new file
Save it as: hello.py (the .py means it's a Python file)
Type the code above
Save the file
Open terminal in VS Code
Type: python hello.py (or python3 hello.py)
You'll see: Hello, World!
Congratulations!
You just wrote and ran your first Python program! You're officially a programmer now. Welcome to the club!

Let's Try More:
Python

print("My name is Python")
print("I am learning programming")
print(2 + 3)
print("2 + 3 =", 2 + 3)
See? Python can do math too! We'll learn more soon.

Python Extension for VS Code
What is an Extension? An EXTENSION is like an add-on that makes VS Code better for Python.

Why Install Python Extension? Without it, VS Code doesn't know you're writing Python (no colors, no help). With it, you get colors, suggestions, and specific Python support.

How to Install:

Open VS Code
Click the Extensions icon (left side, looks like 4 squares)
Search: "Python"
Click "Install" on the one by Microsoft (official one)
Linting - Finding Mistakes Automatically
LINTING is like a spell-checker for code. It finds mistakes before you run your program.

Python

# Wrong code:
prnt("Hello")  # Linter will show check error here!

# Correct code:
print("Hello") # No error
Formatting - Making Code Look Nice
FORMATTING is making your code look neat and organized.

Python

# Unformatted Code (Hard to read)
x=5
y=10
if x
VS Code can format automatically: Right-click > "Format Document".

Running Python Code - Different Ways
Python Shell: Type python in terminal. Good for testing small code.
Running a File: Type python filename.py. Good for actual programs.
Using VS Code: Click the "Run" button (play icon). Most convenient.
Implementations & Execution
Just use CPython (standard Python). When execution happens, your code goes through: Code -> Interpreter -> Bytecode -> Virtual Machine -> Result.

Variables - Storing Information
A VARIABLE is like a BOX that stores information.

Python

name = "Raj"           # string
age = 25               # int
city = "Mumbai"        # string

print("My name is", name)
print(name, "is", age, "years old")
print(name, "lives in", city)
Rules: Must start with letter/underscore. No spaces. Case sensitive.

Strings - Working with Text
A STRING is text data in Python. Anything inside quotes.

Python

name = "Raj"
# Concatenation
print("Hello " + name)

# Repetition
print("Hello " * 3)

# Length
print(len(name)) # 3
Escape Sequences - Special Characters
ESCAPE SEQUENCES are special characters that do special things.

\n = New line
\t = Tab
\\ = Backslash
\" = Double quote
\' = Single quote
Python

print("Line 1\nLine 2")
print("Name:\tRaj")
print("He said \"Hello\"")
Formatted Strings (f-strings)
Use f-strings to insert variables into text. This is the recommended way.

Python

name = "Raj"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old")
String Methods
Python

text = "  Hello World  "
print(text.upper())      # HELLO WORLD
print(text.lower())      # hello world
print(text.strip())      # Hello World (removes spaces)
print(text.replace("World", "Python")) # Hello Python
print(text.find("World")) # 8
Numbers and Operations
Python

print(10 + 5)   # 15 (Add)
print(10 - 5)   # 5 (Subtract)
print(10 * 5)   # 50 (Multiply)
print(10 / 3)   # 3.333 (Division)
print(10 // 3)  # 3 (Floor Division)
print(10 % 3)   # 1 (Modulus/Remainder)
print(2 ** 3)   # 8 (Power)
Type Conversion
Changing data from one type to another.

Python

age = "25"
age_num = int(age) # Converts string to int

price = 99.99
price_str = str(price) # Converts float to string
Comparison Operators
Compare two values and return True or False.

== Equal to
!= Not equal to
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
Python

print(5 == 5)   # True
print(5 != 3)   # True
print(5 > 3)    # True
Conditional Statements
Making decisions.

Python

marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("Grade B")
else:
    print("Grade C")
Ternary Operator
Short way to write if-else.

Python

age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status) # Adult
Logical Operators
Combine conditions: and, or, not.

Python

age = 20
has_id = True
if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("Can enter")
Advanced Conditionals
Short-circuit: Python stops checking if the result is known early.

Chaining: You can chain comparisons.

Python

age = 25
if 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("Working age")
For Loops
Repeating actions.

Python

# Print numbers 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Print items in list
for fruit in ["apple", "banana"]:
    print(fruit)
For Loop with Else
The else block runs after the loop finishes successfully (without hitting a break).

Python

for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop done!")
Nested Loops
A loop inside another loop.

Python

for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)
Iterables
An ITERABLE is anything you can loop over (like a list, string, or range).

While Loops
Repeat until condition becomes False.

Python

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1  # Important: Update i!
Infinite Loops
A loop that never ends. Be careful! Press Ctrl + C to stop it.

Python

while True:
    print("This will run forever")
    # Press Ctrl+C to stop
Functions
Reusable code blocks.

Python

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Raj")   # Output: Hello, Raj!
greet("Priya") # Output: Hello, Priya!
Function Arguments
Arguments are values sent to the function.

Types of Functions
Built-in: Provided by Python (print(), len(), range())
User-defined: Created by you (def my_func():)
Keyword Arguments
You can send arguments with the key = value syntax.

Python

def my_func(c1, c2, c3):
    print(c3 + " is smartest")

my_func(c1="Emil", c2="Tobias", c3="Linus")
Default Arguments
If we call the function without argument, it uses the default value.

Python

def my_func(country="India"):
    print("I am from " + country)

my_func("Sweden")
my_func() # Uses default "India"
*args (Arbitrary Arguments)
If you don't know how many arguments will be passed, use *args.

Python

def my_func(*kids):
    print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])

my_func("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")
Exercises
Print your name and age.
Create a calculator (+, -, *, /).
Check if a number is even or odd.
Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
Write a function to greet someone.
Key Takeaways
Python is easy and powerful.
Indentation is important.
Variables store data.
Loops repeat actions.
Functions reuse code.
Common Mistakes to Avoid
Forgetting colons (:)
Wrong indentation
mispelled variable names
Confusing = (assign) and == (compare)
Final Message
You have taken the first step.

"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." - Lao Tzu

Keep coding, keep learning!

Summary
Variables store data
Strings are text, numbers are numbers
if/else makes decisions
Loops repeat code
Functions organize and reuse code
Programming is practice. Keep writing code!

Tuples with named fields (immutable, lightweight)

Methods:
Python

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)                # Create: Point(x=1, y=2)
p.x                            # Access by name: 1
p.y                            # Access by name: 2
p[0]                           # Access by index: 1
p[1]                           # Access by index: 2
# Immutable: p.x = 3  # ERROR! Cannot modify
When to Use:
Lightweight data structures
Return multiple values
Immutable records
Dictionary keys

Heapq - Priority Queue
Import:
import heapq
Note: Creates MIN-HEAP (smallest at top)

Functions:
Python

heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, 3)         # Push: heap = [3]
heapq.heappush(heap, 1)         # Push: heap = [1, 3]
heapq.heappush(heap, 2)         # Push: heap = [1, 2, 3]
heapq.heappop(heap)             # Pop smallest: returns 1, heap = [2, 3]
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
heapq.heapify(arr)              # Convert to heap: arr = [1, 1, 4, 3, 5]
heapq.heappushpop(heap, 0)      # Push 0 then pop: returns 0
heapq.heapreplace(heap, 5)       # Pop then push 5: returns 2
heap[0]                         # Get smallest: 3 (without removing)
heapq.nlargest(3, [1,2,3,4,5])   # 3 largest: [5, 4, 3]
heapq.nsmallest(2, [3,1,4,1,5])  # 2 smallest: [1, 1]
Max-Heap Trick:
Python

max_heap = []
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -10)   # Push negated: [-10]
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -5)    # Push negated: [-10, -5]
max_val = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Pop and negate: returns 10
When to Use:
Priority queue
K largest/smallest elements
Merge K sorted lists
Dijkstra's algorithm

Bisect - Binary Search
Import:
import bisect
Note: arr must be sorted!

Functions:
Python

arr = [1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7]
bisect.bisect_left(arr, 3)      # Leftmost position: 1
bisect.bisect_left(arr, 4)      # Position to insert 4: 4
bisect.bisect_right(arr, 3)     # Rightmost position: 4
bisect.bisect(arr, 3)           # Same as bisect_right: 4
arr = [1, 3, 5]
bisect.insort_left(arr, 2)      # Insert at leftmost: [1, 2, 3, 5]
bisect.insort_right(arr, 3)     # Insert at rightmost: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]
bisect.insort(arr, 4)           # Same as insort_right: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
When to Use:
Binary search
Maintain sorted list
Find insertion position
Range queries

Itertools - Iteration Tools
Import:
import itertools

Common Algorithms - Quick Reference
Sorting:
Python

# List sorting
arr.sort()                      # In-place
sorted_arr = sorted(arr)        # New list

# Custom sorting
arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])    # Sort by second element
arr.sort(key=len)               # Sort by length

# Multiple criteria
arr.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))  # Sort by second, then first
Searching:
Python

# Linear search
target in arr                   # O(n) - check existence
arr.index(target)               # O(n) - get index

# Binary search (sorted array)
import bisect
pos = bisect.bisect_left(arr, target)  # O(log n)
Finding Min/Max:
Python

min(arr)                        # Minimum
max(arr)                        # Maximum
min(arr, key=len)               # Minimum by key
max(arr, key=len)               # Maximum by key
Counting:
Python

# Using Counter
from collections import Counter
counter = Counter(arr)
counter.most_common(k)         # K most common

# Manual counting
freq = {}
for item in arr:
    freq[item] = freq.get(item, 0) + 1
Grouping:
Python

# Using defaultdict
from collections import defaultdict
groups = defaultdict(list)
for item in arr:
    groups[key].append(item)
Filtering:
Python

filtered = [x for x in arr if condition]  # List comprehension
filtered = filter(lambda x: condition, arr)  # Filter function
Mapping:
Python

mapped = [func(x) for x in arr]  # List comprehension
mapped = map(func, arr)          # Map function
Reducing:
Python

from functools import reduce
result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, arr)  # Sum
result = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr)  # Product

When to Use Which - Quick Guide
Use DEQUE for: Queue/Stack operations, Sliding window, BFS traversal, fast add/remove from both ends.
Use COUNTER for: Frequency counting, most common elements, anagram problems.
Use DEFAULTDICT for: Grouping elements, building graphs, avoiding KeyError.
Use HEAPQ for: Priority queue, K largest/smallest, merge K sorted lists.
Use BISECT for: Binary search, maintaining sorted list, range queries.
Use ITERTOOLS for: Combinations/permutations, Cartesian products, grouping consecutive.
Use FUNCTOOLS for: Memoization needed, function composition, reducing sequences.
